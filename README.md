Imagine a time without Boris Bikes. Your job as a junior developer working for the Transport for London, is to build a new bike system. The plan is to set up a network of Dockin stations across London that anyone can use. Your job is to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, Simulates all the Bikes, and emulates all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff etc). This challenge has been broken down into 22 sub-challenges and they help to build on one another. You will be required to research, plan and find your solution.
